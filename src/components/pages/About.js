          I started coding since Febraury 2020, learning the basics and moving
          onto harder concepts faster. I took note of all the problems and
          difficult topics which I made into cheetsheets for you. For any
          problem, you may encounter on a particular project, feel free to
          contact me <Link to="/contact">here</Link>.
